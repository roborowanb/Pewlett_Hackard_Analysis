# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The silver tsunami is a slow but inevitable wave rolling towards the Pewlett Hackard organization. As the baby boomers head to retirement, the parched talent pool will be in need of some watering before the brain drain begins. We will need to analyze Pewlett Hackards data to determine how many employees are heading into retirement, and then compare that with a set of employees that can enter a mentorship program to fill the gap left behind by the silver tsunami. 


## Results
### The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
We notice here that:
- The largest number of employees nearing retirement have the senior Engineer title
- There are only 2 managers nearing retirement
- Senior staff also have a higher number nearing retirement

### Employees Eligible for the mentorship program
We notice here that:
- There are no duplicate employees and all names listed currently work at pewlett hackard and were born in 1965

## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
After running a query to sum the count of employees nearing retirement, there are 72,458 roles that will need to be replaced at full impact. 
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
After creating a table comparing the number of employees nearing retirement vs eligibile for mentorship, there are definitely enough people nearing retirement to teach the pool of those eligible for mentorship. The question should actually be are there enough employees being mentored to replace those who are nearing retirement. As seen below, there are 153 senior engineers nearing retirement for every senior engineer eligible for mentorship. Even at the lowest levels, in positions like Assistant Engineer, there are still 13 nearing retirement for every one eligible for mentorship.
